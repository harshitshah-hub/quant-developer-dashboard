## ChatGPT Usage Transparency

This project utilized ChatGPT (GPT-5) for:
- Structuring the overall assignment plan and folder layout.
- Writing boilerplate code for Streamlit dashboard components and modular backend files.
- Debugging data ingestion and z-score calculations.
- Drafting documentation (README.md) and refining explanations.

Sample prompts included:
- "Design a modular architecture for a real-time Streamlit dashboard using Binance WebSocket data."
- "Generate OLS-based hedge ratio and z-score analytics in Python."
- "Explain how to structure a Quant Developer assignment README."

All generated code and text were reviewed, tested, and modified manually to ensure correctness and originality.
